 An automatisation system for withdrawing Linkedin data by using Selenium webdriver. 
 
linkedinsearchingjob file: I alwasy was having a look jobs requiring Python skills in Berlin and that small project created an automatisation system that directly goes to Linkedin and search jobs that requires Python in Berlin by using my Linkedin credentials.
 
 linkedinaddingnetworks  file : That file goes to Linkedin and withdraw my network list into a txt data. 
 
 
 Be sure that your webdriver's location path should  be correct when webdriver is formed.I keep my driver in my Desktop >>>>> browser=webdriver.Chrome("/Users/OBO/Desktop/chromedriver") and selenim module is installed.
 
 
 I did not enter my Linkedin credentials into here, that is why if you run this code, you are asked to enter your Linkedin credentials.However, working on my own, i have written my credentials into the file.  That is why my information is writtern automatically. You can reach a short video from here about this working: https://recordit.co/fFMyd24wQ6
